# CV
This project was created during my participation in a course called "GoIT Marathon" run by the GoIT company.
The course dealt with the basics of programming in HTML and CSS.
The data presented in the index.html file is a task we were supposed to perform - create my CV and fill it with my data, as if six months of study were behind me and I want to start recruiting for IT.
